# Quick-etc-hosts
Are you tired of having to constantly open `nano` everytime you want to add an entry to your hosts file? Does your hosts file look like a messy divorce with duplicates and different formatting? Do you want to waste 100KB on your hard drive just for the sake of leisure?

Never fear, `quick-etc-hosts` is here!
